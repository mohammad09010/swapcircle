# SwapCircle Code of Conduct

## Purpose
SwapCircle is a university team project. We will work respectfully, safely, and professionally. This code of conduct protects the team’s well-being and ensures fair contribution.

## Our standards
We will:
- Communicate respectfully and professionally.
- Be reliable: attend meetings or notify the team early.
- Use constructive feedback (focus on the work, not the person).
- Respect different skill levels and help each other learn.
- Use GitHub issues/PRs to make work visible and trackable.
- Follow secure and ethical development practices.

We will not:
- Harass, insult, or discriminate.
- Share private information (emails, addresses, passwords).
- Upload copyrighted media (full album scans/audio) into the repo.
- Sabotage work or block progress.

## Collaboration rules
- All work goes through GitHub issues + branches + pull requests (PRs).
- PRs should be small and explain what changed.
- If you break the build, you fix it or ask for help immediately.
- Disagreements are resolved with evidence (requirements, rubric, tests).

## Meeting expectations
- Weekly stand-up in lab time.
- Each member reports: what they did, what they’ll do next, blockers.
- Meeting notes recorded in `/docs/meeting-notes/`.

## If problems happen
1. Raise the issue calmly in the team chat or meeting.
2. If unresolved, request a short meeting with the lecturer (as per module process).
3. The lecturer/team retains the final decision on dismissal/appeals as stated in the brief.
